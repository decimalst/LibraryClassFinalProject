# LibraryClassFinalProject

## What is this?
This is a final project for the javascript class of Spring 2019 at the Newark Free library. The rest of the class notes and exercises can be found [in this repo.](https://github.com/patelaj94/JavascriptSpring2019)

In this project, we give you the skeleton for a personal website with an about me, a resume, and a blog. Some aspects are stubbed out with basic functionality(e.g. blog comments are temporal), so full implementation is left as an exercise for the reader. 

The purpose of the final project is to summarize, incorporate and reinforce the concepts we went over in class. Give it your best attempt, and if you're not sure about something, bring it to us in class and we'll help.

## How do I get started?

1. Clone this repository with git.
2. Copy the html and javascript files in the "site" directory into plnkr, or open them in your browser.
3. Follow along the different tasks in the "to-do.txt" file
4. Save your files to your local computer after you complete the tasks in the "to-do" file.
